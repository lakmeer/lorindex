Raspberries are a popular fruit known for their rich color and sweet, tangy taste. They
belong to the genus Rubus, in the rose family. There are several species of raspberries,
including red, black, purple, and yellow varieties. The red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) is
the most commonly cultivated species. These small, heart-shaped berries are a composite
fruit, consisting of many individual drupelets around a central core. Each drupelet
contains a seed, contributing to the raspberry's textured feel.
