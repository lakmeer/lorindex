  - /<topic>#tags       Filter topic items by tags
  - /<topic>!type       Filter topic items by type
  - /?question          Results of an assistant question
  - /<topic>?question   Topic items, plus results of question

游릭 Use `vss_distance_l2` for `db/distance`
游댮 Move env values to localStorage
游댮 Experiment:
  1. Split item text into sentences
  2. Embed sentances directly
  3. Embed whole text
  4. Find average position of sentance embedding vectors
  5. Compare distance to whole-text embedding
游댮 Assistant
  - Ability to ask the assistant a question about the content with `?`
    - Assistant will be fed current document view for context
    - Asking the assistant a question inline in the document produces an assistant-type
      block, which is not an item and won't be persisted
    - Assistant blocks should be visually distinct
  - Functions available to the assistant
    - Inject other blocks into the view
      - Make the UI not remove injected blocks when the search settings change
      - Injected blocks will be forgotten when topic changes
        - Or not??
    - Retag stuff
    - Delete stuff
    - Check for contradictions with other items
